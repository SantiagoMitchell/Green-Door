  <h2>EPA Certification and Vehicles</h2>
  <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for setting and enforcing fuel economy standards for vehicles in the United States. Cars that meet these standards are awarded an EPA certification, which indicates that they are environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient.</p>
  <p>The most common type of EPA certification for vehicles is the Fuel Economy and Environment label, which provides important information for vehicle owners including the estimated fuel economy and annual fuel cost for the vehicle, as well as information on the vehicle's emissions. This label is required by law to be displayed on all new cars and light-duty trucks.</p>
  <p>One of the benefits of owning a car with an EPA certification is that you can save money on gas over time. Vehicles with higher fuel efficiency typically have lower annual fuel costs, which can add up to significant savings over the life of the vehicle. In addition, cars with an EPA certification often have a higher resale value because they are in demand by environmentally conscious buyers.</p>
  <p>Another benefit of EPA certifications is that they help to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles are a significant source of air pollution and contribute to climate change through the release of greenhouse gases. By setting and enforcing fuel economy standards, the EPA is helping to reduce the environmental impact of vehicles and promote cleaner, more sustainable transportation.</p>
  <p>It's important to note that not all vehicles are eligible for EPA certification. Heavy-duty trucks and buses have different standards and are subject to separate certification requirements. Additionally, vehicles that are modified or altered in a way that affects their emissions or fuel efficiency may not be eligible for certification.</p>
  <p>EPA certifications are an important part of promoting fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly vehicles. If you're in the market for a new car, be sure to look for vehicles with an EPA certification, as they can provide significant savings on gas and have a positive impact on the environment. By supporting the development and sale of these vehicles, you can help to promote a cleaner, more sustainable transportation system for future generations.</p>
